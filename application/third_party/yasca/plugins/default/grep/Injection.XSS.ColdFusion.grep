	<p>
		Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker to 
		impersonate or perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
		
		This particular issue is caused by inserting information from the URL or a form
		parameter directly within the returned HTML:
		<code>
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="username" value="#url.someParameteer#"/gt;
		</code>
		The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing a victim to visit a URL
		with specially crafted JavaScript to perform actions on the site on behalf of the 
		attacker, or to simply steal the session cookie.
