<p>
	This injection vulnerability allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from 
	the web/application server into the returned HTML page. An example of this is
	a JSP page that takes a <b>file</b> parameter, as in:
	<ul>
		<li>http://www.server.com/index.jsp?file=home.jsp</li>
	</ul>
	
	The script would presumably include the home.jsp file in its returned content. By
	changing home.jsp to /etc/passwd or another sensitive file, an attacker would have
	that file returned instead of home.jsp.
	
	It is recommended to perform strict validation in this scenario, where only specific
	files are allowed to be passed in through the <b>file</b> parameter.
	These passwords should be changed to something stronger.
