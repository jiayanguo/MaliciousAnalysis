<p>
	Resources should usually be included using relative links, so they can work even if the system directory
	or mount point changes. In this case, the finding is that a link to a local Windows resource (such as
	"c:\my source code\some file.txt" exists in the code base. Unless the target production platform is 
	Windows, and there is a compelling need for referencing an absolute path, this should be changed.
