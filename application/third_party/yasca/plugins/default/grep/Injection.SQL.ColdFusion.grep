        <h4>Possible SQL Injection</h4>
        SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a security vulnerability occurring in the database
        layer of an application. The vulnerability is present when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal
        escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and thereby unexpectedly executed. It
        is an instance of a more general class of vulnerabilities that can occur whenever one programming or scripting language
        is embedded inside another. SQL injection attacks are also known as SQL insertion attacks.
