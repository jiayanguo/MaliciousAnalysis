                            INSTALLATION GUIDE

    Thank you for downloading Yasca! This installation guide will help
    you install Yasca on either Windows or Linux. If you run into any
    problems, please contact me at scovetta@users.sourceforge.net,
    leave feedback at yasca.org, or open a bug on the SourceForge
    project page. Feedback is always welcome!


    Installation Steps (Windows):

        1. Download yasca-core.zip and unzip it into a directory. For
           example, c:\yasca.

	    2. If you wish to use any third-party plugins, download and
           install them into the same directory. These tools must be
           downloaded from the Yasca project page because I've placed
           files in specific locations so that Yasca can find them. 
           The directory that you unzip the plugins into does not have to
           reside within Yasca-Core. For example, you can install PMD into:

             c:\static-tools\

           For example:

             unzip yasca-2.1-pmd.zip c:\static-tools\

           Your directory structure should look like:
             c:\static-tools\3rdParty-Binaries
             c:\static-tools\3rdParty-Source
             c:\static-tools\doc
             c:\static-tools\resources
             c:\static-tools\install.txt


        3. Point Yasca to this directory to pick up any available plugins.
             
             yasca -sa_home c:\static-tools\ <target directory>

           Alternatively, you can set the SA_HOME environment variable to
           the directory instead.

             set SA_HOME=c:\static-tools\
             yasca <target directory>


		4. Note that for some plugins, you'll need to have Java installed.
           See the installation documents for specific plugins to see what
           the requirements are.

        5. From the Yasca installation directory, scan resources\test:

             c:\yasca> yasca resources\test


    Installation Steps (Linux):

        1. Download yasca-core.zip and unzip it into a directory. For
           example, /opt/yasca.


	    2. If you wish to use any third-party plugins, download and
           install them into the same directory. These tools must be
           downloaded from the Yasca project page because I've placed
           files in specific locations so that Yasca can find them. 
           The directory that you unzip the plugins into does not have to
           reside within Yasca-Core. For example, you can install PMD into:

             c:\static-tools\

           For example:

             unzip yasca-2.1-pmd.zip c:\static-tools\

           Your directory structure should look like:
             c:\static-tools\3rdParty-Binaries
             c:\static-tools\3rdParty-Source
             c:\static-tools\doc
             c:\static-tools\resources
             c:\static-tools\install.txt


        3. Point Yasca to this directory to pick up any available plugins.
             
             yasca -sa_home c:\static-tools\ <target directory>

           Alternatively, you can set the SA_HOME environment variable to
           the directory instead.

             set SA_HOME=c:\static-tools\
             yasca <target directory>


        3. Verify that PHP 5 is installed:

		     # php -v

             PHP 5.3.0 (cli) (built: Jun 29 2009 21:55:01)
             Copyright (c) 1997-2009 The PHP Group
             Zend Engine v2.3.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2009 Zend Technologies

        4. Verify that php-xml is installed:

             # php -m

             [PHP Modules]
             ...
             xml
             ...


		5. Install Java 1.5 or later. This is required for a few of the
           plugins. See doc/REQUIREMENTS for a full list.

             # java -version

             java version "1.6.0_06"
             Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_06-b02)
             Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 10.0-b22, mixed mode)


        6. From the /opt/yasca directory, scan resources/test:

             # yasca resources/test


    Installation Steps (MySQLReport Report Generator):

        1. Create a MySQL database.

        2. Execute the etc/yasca.mysql script to create the necessary
           table structure.

        3. Use the "-d" command line option to pass the database credentials
           to the Yasca engine. For example:

           DB_CREDS="db_server=localhost:3306&database=yasca
                     &db_usernname=yasca&db_password=yasca123"

           yasca -r MySQLReport -d "$DB_CREDS" /opt/source_code
